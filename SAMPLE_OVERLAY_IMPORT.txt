SCORING RUBRIC

**EXCELLENT (0.81 - 1.00)**
Comprehensive demonstration of exceptional team capability and capacity. All key roles clearly defined with highly qualified personnel who have extensive, directly relevant experience. Strong evidence of organizational infrastructure and robust systems to support delivery. Team members have demonstrable track record of successful delivery in highly similar contexts. Detailed, realistic resource allocation with significant contingency planning. The response inspires complete confidence in the team's ability to deliver.

**GOOD (0.61 - 0.80)**
Strong demonstration of team capability and capacity with most key roles well-defined. Team members have relevant qualifications and good experience, though some gaps may exist in direct relevance. Organizational infrastructure is adequate with clear support systems. Good track record of delivery in related contexts. Resource allocation is realistic with some contingency measures identified. The response provides substantial confidence in the team's ability to deliver.

**ADEQUATE (0.41 - 0.60)**
Satisfactory demonstration of basic team capability and capacity. Key roles are identified, and team members have relevant qualifications, though experience may be less directly applicable. Organizational infrastructure is present but may lack detail or robustness. Some evidence of previous delivery, though not necessarily in closely related contexts. Resource allocation is outlined but may lack detail or appear optimistic. The response suggests the team should be able to deliver with reasonable support.

**WEAK (0.21 - 0.40)**
Limited demonstration of team capability or capacity. Key roles may be unclear or gaps exist in critical areas. Team members have some relevant qualifications, but experience is limited or not clearly demonstrated. Organizational infrastructure is vague or underdeveloped. Little evidence of track record in relevant contexts. Resource allocation is unclear, appears insufficient, or lacks realism. The response raises concerns about the team's ability to deliver.

**UNACCEPTABLE (0.00 - 0.20)**
Inadequate demonstration of team capability or capacity. Key roles undefined or missing, team members lack relevant qualifications or experience, organizational infrastructure absent or highly questionable. No evidence of track record in relevant contexts. Resource allocation missing, clearly insufficient, or unrealistic. The response provides no confidence in the team's ability to deliver the project successfully.

**Weight:** 1

**Max Score:** 1.00
