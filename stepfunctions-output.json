This represents a critical failure that prevents any assessment of the proposal's merits.\n\nThe evaluation criteria require applicants to address multiple essential components: the main project motivation, the specific health/healthcare challenge or need, analysis of similar innovations and competitors, documentation of prior work, consideration of wider contextual challenges (economic, social, environmental, cultural, political, regulatory), evidence of market demand both nationally and internationally, and documented input from healthcare professionals, patients, partners, or supply chain representatives. None of these elements are present in the submitted document.\n\nWhile the document passed automated structure validation (100/100), this appears to be a technical anomaly as the structure validator was checking against an empty JSON template rather than the actual proposal content requirements. The content analysis correctly identified the fundamental problem, awarding 0/100 and noting the file corruption. The grammar check score of 85/100 is irrelevant as it appears to have evaluated the evaluation criteria document itself rather than the (non-existent) proposal content.\n\nImmediate action required: The applicant must resubmit a properly formatted document containing an actual written response to Question 9 (maximum 400 words) plus the optional 2-page PDF appendix with supporting diagrams or charts.
